# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
This is a rock paper scissors game I made for the Udacity Intro to programing nanodegree.
This is the first program I wrote working with Classes in Python. 
It has a few different AI classes that the human player can play against.
If I addon to this it will be with a way for the game to randomlly pick the AI player each time.
